  This report is submitted to the University of Hertfordshire with a
  view to progression to the final stage of completing the author's
  PhD. The project is to devised methods for considering the automatic REM
  observations taken by the Red Dots Project of three {\rdwarf} objects,
  specifically \prox, {\bstar} and \ross. Initially, particular attention was
  paid to to \ross.
  
  This report details the work done to date and the intended future directions
  to be taken to complete the project.
  
  A draft paper relating to {\ross} is provided with this report which is
  intended to be read together with it.
